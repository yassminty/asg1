this project is my first time doing a site from scratch, using html/css/javascript. i am doing this project for my assignment and it will be about a band that i really like

# design process
my main goal for making this website project is to just create a fanpage for this band that i really like, Sleeping Token, as they may or may not be gaining traction. they already have an official website however, i wanted to make my website a simpler way for new listeners to get to know the band and get their merchandise easily.

this is my url for my adobe XD wireframe: https://xd.adobe.com/view/49a02269-85aa-4855-bbfc-68720153b12d-1cf3/

# features
some features that i have implemented in my website is a simpler UX for new listeners to navigate through the website and get to know more about them

# existing features
the existing features of the site includes the main page about the band, the gallery, a form to be informed about the band and get the latest news, their merch page and their tour dates
