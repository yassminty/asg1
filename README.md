this project is my first time doing a site from scratch, using html/css/javascript

# design process
my main goal for making this website project is to just create a fanpage for this band that i really like, Sleeping Token, as they may or may not be gaining traction. they already have an official website however, i wanted to make my website a simpler way for new listeners to get to know the band and get their merchandise easily.

this is my url for my adobe XD wireframe:
